# Activity 3
Used a 1k resistor with green LED. Set the power supply to 5V (limited amps to 0.7, 3.3V also worked) and got blinking functionality from
the board. Set up board as follows: power connected to VSYS and Output pin set to GP1 on the board.

# Activity 3 Measurments
0.020A = 20mA measured on the board with 5V input to VSYS.
